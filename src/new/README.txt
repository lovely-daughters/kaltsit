The goal is large. It's not just automating a certain task, but automating all gachas as a whole.

It takes hours to properly run a program that is a couple of clicks long. 

There needs to be a better way to simulate
and generate the necessary instructions

OK, lets first start off with something simple.
Generate a decision tree. 

Take in a state, and decide an action based upon the state
understanding where in the state tree you are. 

this is extremely important

STATES

banshee hunt team selection menu => start
hunt running => wait
hunt finished => try again => selection menu

this should be the general states

connection issue => try again
